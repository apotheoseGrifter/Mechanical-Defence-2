====================
To download, click the 'Download ZIP' button on the bottom right-hand side of the page. Remember to DELETE all previous
versions of the mod if updating, do not just overwrite the old version. This is because some xml files may have had their
names changed, or have been removed.

--------------------

To install the optional parts of the mod, go into the 'Addons' folder (located in the root directory of the mod) and
open the .rar file of the part you wish to add. Drag the files located inside this archive into the 'Defs' folder of the
mod. Click yes to merge all folders, nothing should need to be overwritten.
